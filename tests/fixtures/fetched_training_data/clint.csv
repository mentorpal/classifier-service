I so most right. I've been a student this whole entire time, and I have done some jobs. I've worked for the for NASA. I've worked for Institute for Creative Technologies at USC. I've done I've seen what software engineers do, and, um, they get a lot of pay for, um, strenuous work, no doubt. But there's no comparison for getting maybe paid half what? Your half. What your civilian counterparts get but doing ah lot more work for and most people in Navy don't Don't consider this. You could get paid more as you go askew. Go further in your career.

If you've been through high school, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. But it's revved up a little bit more here because, um, people's salaries are on the lines. People's day to day activities are on lines. Um, you could get fired for certain things. Um, if your gun decking, for instance, you can you can actually go to jail.

So we have these things called annual trainings and being in the surge main unit, we actually go toe five different places. We could go toe Hawaii or Norfolk or New Hampshire, Japan, Um, and, uh, other small places as well. So for the most part, they really want you to go toe one place so you can know the people and get to know your job Well, but as the chief, I decided to go toe all of those places because, hey, why not? You know, it's not gonna hurt anything. And I don't actually want to know where my people are and what they're doing, eh?

And being a kid that was currently working at McDonald's, that sounded great. You know, like, uh, now I can have that $100,000 your job. No problem. Um, they said, Oh, you know, you become a veteran and you go to the Post Graduate School and they provide a lot of different things. But to tell you the truth, all of those kind of sift into the back to the background. Um, I'm still the name of this at this time, and I didn't become a nuclear, um, operator. At the end, however, I did get the challenge that they were talking about. That's the thing that really drove me tojoin the nuclear propulsion school. And that's the thing that I think I got the most out of. I was challenged more than I ever had been in my life, and that's something that you can't put a price on And that that's a job that I don't think that most of the other jobs that I saw the Navy wouldn't provide as much as, um, after getting out of the active duty service, I was a chief. And, of course, I love, you know, providing opportunities for people and helping them promote their career, You know, like all chiefs will say that. But what I personally like for myself about being, um, still in the Navy reserves is to travel. I did a lot of port calls when I was in active duty. And I'm telling you, I went to 13 different countries. Uh, Dubai, Bahrain. Kuwait, um, Japan, You know, dozens of places, but being in the reserve, you actually go to these places. They give you a car, they give you a hotel. Uh, they give you a decent work, they give you money in your pocket and on the weekends you can explore. So I've seen New York and the capital and, um, New Hampshire, places that I didn't think that I would go for a long time. I've seen Washington and you know, swimming the beaches of Hawaii, and they say that I'm working. That's that's incredible because I think that it's kind of like a or work vacation.",

That's also right there is exploring different parts of the country that all of that is absolutely true. And you'll check all those boxes. Um, What I have found that the preconception that I had coming in that hasn't been true is, um Well, I want to say the fitness, we're all kind of fit, and I think we're generally more fit than the rest of society. However, I thought like you'd be big and strong and, you know, exercising every day. And, um, that's not quite true. In the Navy, at least it might be for the Army or the Marines or other services. But for the Navy, um, generally, you're stationed on an aircraft care and there are tons of electric of exercise equipment, no doubt, and you can go at five o'clock in the morning and you can see it's full. They also give you lots of Jim facilities that people go through all the time. I was in the basketball court almost everyday. However, um, it's generally not so required that you're exercising, um, with everybody at the whole time. My dad was in the Army and I actually saw his whole crew like running around the building, run around the camps and things, So I thought I'd have a similar experience with the Navy. But that's actually not true. Generally your physical fitness is more your own thing, and you could just get tested on it a lot.",

Electrical equipment. However, once you become a new electrical operator, you deal less with fixing things. Um, there's a caveat to that. If you go on a submarine, then they don't have regular electrician's. There are only nukes Nuke Electrician's. So then you're you're fixing laundry machines and changing lights and, uh, changing out pumps. And you know, there's there's only so many people on that ship. So you're expected to do everything, however, on an aircraft care, which is where I was, um, other electrician's. They take care of everything above the plants below the plants. There aren't that many, um, really complicated electrical things that you have to fix. Our goal was just toe maintain things. So there's a turbine generator. You take off everything, you dust it off, you increase it up and you put it back. If there is something broken. Oh, yeah, You know, the they tend toe pull in and they take off the whole entire machine and put a whole new contraption on it.

So I thought, Well, once I joined the reserves, Well, that's gonna be one of last times that I'm actually dealing with, like, controlling what gets fixed and how it gets fixed. But yeah, I just recently on the USS Blue Ridge, I found myself even as reserve chief, overseeing a group of 15 electrician's, and we actually were in charge of fixing the whole entire ship from the bottom of the hole all the way to the top. Massive antenna. Um, I was in the radar room. I was in the navigation room. I was up on Vulture's row. I was dealing with how to fix the didn't fix the helicopters, but how to do the electrical checks on the helicopters.

So, for instance, now, um, for a normal workday, I could work, like maybe 12 or 13 hours. Whereas when I started, it was like, nine. But, um, what's more important is the type of work that you do. So when you first come in, um, you just told what to do is like, Hey, you know what? Like we have toe get this pump changed out, Um, get the grapples and, you know, take it out. Um, five years later, you're a part of the cruise like, Hey, you take those four people for people and you go and take that pump out five years after that, Uh, then you're the person that tells that one person to go do it, and you're actually not at the scene. Sometimes you're not at the scene on Ben. They just tell you Hey, we just did it. Um, you still have the same amount of work because there's a lot of paperwork that goes along with it.

So, for instance, um, people can come to you and you work through problems together. Um, it depends on the type of person that you are.

So with that in mind, when they come to you, whether they know that you're gonna be stern and strict and maybe have a few, um, strong words in there or if you're nice and sweet and kind, uh, they have to know that you know what?

But the more important question is where I get those answers from the reason that I have all the answers is because I have ah crew of people behind me that can back me up that have the answers throughout all of the people. And, um what first classes? The problem that I've seen in upcoming 1st and 2nd class is is thinking that they are the ones that that the information comes from themselves. And in that case you probably get some wrong answers. Um, depending on what they're saying. So, for instance, um, you're talking about an award. Oh, well, this award needs needs this and that. And you don't you don't need it. You don't need that block filled out. Well, some of those things could be wrong, but because they're under such stress toe actually provide an answer. They provide some answer the difference between new answers and, for instance, Chiefs. The chief will say, You're supposed to felt this block this block. It's supposed to be filled out like this.

And once you know how they interact with each other, uh, you're bound to find some kind of dissension among these peoples. Um, they have lots of time together outside of work. Um, they might see each other at bars. Some of them might be dating other people that might have family problems. And those small problems can actually filter in into the unit now. Generally, there's not so much of a problem with that. That's how come you have, like people high fiving and people joking around and people like, uh, tapping each other. You want that kind of familial bond? But, um, if there is a problem, for instance, like, let's say, two people are dating and then they break up, then they're not gonna wanna work with each other or they're gonna work with each other bad. And for the most part, uh, it tends to go away. But if you don't take care of it, it can grow to be really, really, really big problem. Um, people's lives on the line. And if you have somebody that doesn't want to go down and check on someone when they're supposed to, or if you have someone that says like, hey, argument with this personal yesterday and I'm going to give him a bad recommendation, things like that that could get really, uh, out of hand pretty fast.",

Um, it can't be crossed over. They generally say that once you become a chief, all of the friends that you had, you know, if they were in your corner and if they were going to bat for you, then they'll understand the distinction that has to be drawn once you become a chief and they're not gonna treat you the same way that they did before. So you used to go toe clubbing or bars or joking around about the latest people on board this ship. All of that stops completely. So in that case, once you turn that switch off, how do you turn it back on? All the people have toe develop a new type of respect for you. Uh, it generally comes from the fact that you're very knowledgeable about your your subject. That's why you're promoted in the first place. And the second part has to do with the fact that you're caring for them. You know you're caring for them as a team member and that you're looking out for their safety. With those two pieces in mind, um, the balance will actually, um, come as a side point. Um, whenever they become the the same leadership position is useful. For instance, off. You know, third class petty officers become first class petty officers, first class, first class. Petty Officer has become chiefs and chiefs. Maybe they become officers. Once those huge balance or jumped, then you're able toe like I have the same communion, but, um, you definitely need to make that distinction.",

Uh, it went along. Lines of this, uh, the leaders that are most beloved are the ones that just, like, tell anybody everything, uh, next is most feared, uh, next to the ones who like, um, are really prized among everyone, but the ones who they're most effective are the invisible ones. It basically went like that. So I think that the mawr invisible you are as a leader. Um, even though you are controlling things from behind the scenes, uh, more credit that you give him, the better he'll respect you and you'll see it, um, devolved into the group. Ah, lot more if they take more responsibility of their actions. Um, even though they have a lot to learn and you are teaching them a lot, um, you don't want that to filter down to the crew. So, for instance, um, my first class would come into my office say, Hey, this needs to be on. I give him the exact instructions so that he can't fail. Then he goes out, and he described it to the crew. Now, little do the crew new do the little Does the crew know that I'm the one who actually explained things to him.

And, um, as a leader, you have to get that same job done without actually doing it. It's kind of weird, I know, but your role is to tell someone else to do it. And I've seen a lot of leaders have that problem, especially people that that have the new position. So a second class becomes the first class. I'd actually have to go down there and tell them.

So for me, my e is whenever somebody gets promoted, um, second to that is whenever anyone gets an award and although that's not necessarily on my record, I do get, you know, some kind of credit for that. Um, I just feel like it's more important kind of like handing down the torch to someone else, and I think that's that's one of the best things that you can have as you grew up in leadership.",

Hey, you know, I'll go out and, like, fix all this equipment and then, you know, half the day is over, and then they come back with only one thing changed or two things changed when it should have been the whole things. How do you change that? Well, number one, you have to be very, very clear. Um, these are the leaders, and those three leaders are affecting thes five people. The place that I've been where that hasn't been, the case was very disorganized, and no one knew exactly what they were supposed to be doing. Another thing about being very clear. Hey, these are the rules that expect you to do You have a white board, you label number 123 claiming cellini cells change the pump, fixed the valve, and then you check on those things. Hey, was this done? It is done. Green check. Mark, Wait for the next thing um, yeah. So being being clear and organized are the things that I e I think make the biggest change.

It was really confusing when I joined. I didn't know anything about engineering or electron ICS. When I first came in, it took me the longest time to figure out what a ground was. Everyone kept saying it was the Earth that it was like dirt. You know, I didn't understand how it like, uh, match with electrical work. Um, a couple years in after hearing the same things over and over and over, you start to get good at it a couple years after that. Then you start to become a master at it. Um, a few years after that, then you're in the position that you can actually teach. It s so it's got gotten easier the longer that I've been in, just like with any other job.",

You know it's gonna be coming at you all the time every single day, several times a day. The way that I prepared for myself, um, for coming into the nuclear power school actually started training. Um, I took a conceptual physics course and I took algebra, and that helped me through the school. Later on, um, after going through my initial school thing, I found out that, like, uh, even though there are schools available most of the time, you have to actually train yourself. So learning how to read is another big thing that you have to know. Um, if you haven't been a big reader before, especially in high school or middle school, um, that's gonna change if you're gonna be promoted. Um, of course, there are lots of opportunities and lots of training, but the ones I see succeed the most are the ones who actually can pick up a book on their off time and kind of teach themselves.",

And that was, you know, going on Google and looking here and, um, asking around and, you know, going to another office and saying, Hey, what's the policy on this, you know, kind of like, uh, wagon, my my telling a circle. But, um, before I joined the chief strings, and especially afterwards, I swapped up my leadership style. They actually taught me how to become a better leader. Um, a little bit during, um, my second class and my third class years, but a lot, especially during my first class years. And after I became in chief, uh, they told me which websites to visit. Uh, they told me, like which people in the separate departments toe go visit. So it's not necessarily a skill, um, of knowing how to do something but more about knowing who to talk to knowing that that was a resource that I had that I wasn't taking advantage of before",

Um, that was a really big surprise to me. Is the difference between the different ranks? Um, you have pity officers, then you have chiefs, and then you have officers and, um, they're split by whether you have a bachelor's degree and whether you've been commissioned. And I didn't really understand that critical piece until, like, well, in tow. After the time that I joined the join the service, um, for instance, people were being called Chiefs and Master Chiefs while I was in boot camp. They were saying, Well, you know, like if we don't do these certain things, there's certain things that, um, things first class is gonna make a chief and I didn't really understand, Like how you were supposed to be promoted along the lines of the military. Um, being a kid, I just thought, all right, your private I knew what that was, and I heard that there was an admiral and I knew what that was. And I thought you just joined. And then you just stay in. You get better and better and better at your job, and then you're finally you know an admiral or something. I had no idea about the rank structure.

You know what? We have this ship in, uh, in Guam. We need to get it over to this other island. We have these problems with it. You know, this pump over here effects this pump be over there and without that pump than this other machine is gonna work, and you have to kind of understand all of it. Now, the sailors under you don't necessarily need to know that whole entire thing. It's gonna overwhelm them. Some of them have just been in for a few months. Others a year or two, and they're they're just getting the feel for the Navy. So they they're not gonna understand all of those other pieces of equipment or how they operate, But they don't need to. And that's the point. That's your whole goal as a chief, to separate the critical from the non critical. Um, so yeah, that our long conversation that I had talking about How we as a group as a ship as a department are going to get the ship from a to B. I filter that down to say, Hey, you know what? Third class, Petty officer, second class Petty officer, We have, uh, that's led to sell. That needs to be taken out and provided with this new one. Can you guys do that? Yes.

You have time to eat lunch, But when you know, there's a test on Monday and you don't really know much about the material, you spend that whole entire weekend from sunup to sundown just studying. And I would like to say that that whole entire two year training that I had learning about electron ICS and he transferred fluid flow and nuclear technology in chemistry. Um, doesn't quite compare to the training that I got once I got to the USS John C. Stennis that a lot of, um, even non nukes are gonna experience. And this is what I mean, when you're in school, you're in a nice, safe environment. Um, the sun is shining. You can kind of see out the window, but basically, you're at a desk and you're typing and your writing and your, um, listening on did you don't develop too much sweat. But when you're on the ship, uh, you can have some days that are just as long or even longer. Um, when things could break because of you, when people get hurt, sometimes when you're falling asleep. But you're keeping yourself awake by drinking lots of coffee.

You shouldn't be having any trouble when you get to a new unit. Um, I've known several people that came from U. S s warrior and they were immediately put on the USS Blue Ridge and they slid right in. You know, after the second day, you couldn't tell them apart from anybody else, somebody that that just came in, he would not be able to say, Hey, you know what? Like this is a new guy. Um, that's the way the Navy is supposed to work when it doesn't. Then that's, uh, that's a time that, you know, you and the chief need to talk about what? What the problems are. Is it a personality problem? Is it the fact that you're dealing with this new equipment, that you don't know? Um, how to operate yet? But it shouldn't be that that case at all ast faras personality. We all try to be the same here. We try to be accepting opening a new person in the unit that makes our our unit better that makes our work go down. So you shouldn't have a problem. Uh, sliding into the unit assed faras work that you're getting, um we generally start you off at the level that you're supposed to be.

If you're second class, you should be familiar with, um, how to read Bull's eyes. How Toe transit about the ship.

Um, I'm unsure about this or I know about this, but tell me about your personal situation there. There's tons of ways that you can ask these questions. Um, books air fine.

So if I had two superstars thin, what I would try to do is I would try to get one of the superstars off and try to get someone who's learning, you know, kind of keep it balanced.

It's written in black and white, and whatever instruction says, that's what you should do now, of course, uh, in specific occasions, there are way that there are opportunities when you have a choice. Like, um, I can't think of a situation now But, uh, that's kind of not black and white, but for the most part, for jobs, Um, I try to lead by example by always following instructions and especially pulling out construction, reading directly from what it says and then doing it.",

What's good is being able to explain all of it. What's better? What's you know? Just as good is being able to fill out the first page and not knowing what Block 28 29 are saying, Hold on, coming back in an hour and saying, Oh, Block 20 is this Block 29. Is this What's bad is saying, Oh, this is how you felt the first page and I don't know, But this is how you fill out block 28 29.

But for me, if whenever I wanted toe really build a connection with people you have thio get outside off the work environment and I mean, I mean it like this. You have to know about the people outside of the job that they're doing. It could be learning about their family. It could be knowing about their kids. It doesn't have to be super friendly. It doesn't say, Hey, you know what? Let's go drinking on a Saturday afternoon. But it should be saying, Hey, you know what? I care about you more than just my subordinate justice worker that I that I have, um, I care about your life to, um not just like your safety, but also your well being.

So, for instance, if there are morale, recreation and warfare things that you can do together, um, that would be helpful. Um, one thing that I used to like to do is like, exercise together, saying, Hey, you know what? This Friday afternoon, uh, let's put on a PT gear and just, like, run together. Um, if it's an easy Friday, then let's go out and play some volleyball together. Um, you don't really have that much opportunity to do that. Let's say Let's it, let's say if you're underway, then, um, there aren't any weekends on the beach. So what do you do then? Well, you have to make sure that the team has enough enough material outside of the work so that they can actually communicate with each other. Um, in a friendly way. That means make sure that they have enough movies. If they if they were complaining about their lunch, making sure that they're well fed, you know, go talk to the galleys, remember and say, Hey, you know what? We have this birthday coming up. Can you bring a birthday cake in Thio to celebrate somebody's, um, somebody's birthday. You could actually have this award, you know, before you weren't really considered an award, but saying, Hey, you know what? Like it would really lift the spirits off the unit, help somebody with promotion. Let me think of how I can, uh, come up with an award, you know, make some kind of jobs so that they can get that award when you wouldn't have thought so. Otherwise. Like, there are many avenues that you have toe, Um, just not shove work down people's throats and say, Hey, you know what? Like we're in a team. I know this place is really long.

I was the second class, you know, a couple of months ago. I don't have the right to boss them around, despite my my new title. Chiefs have to understand. Hey, you know what? Even though I can boss people around, I don't want to, because they have to work for me. And officers have to realize that Yes, I have a commission. And yes, I am your commissioned officer, but, um, ultimately, you guys are the ones doing the work, and I have to respect that. So if everyone knows their role and they don't abuse their rules, uh, that's the best way to get along. So how can you do that? Well, you have to make sure that each of those lines is very, very clear. Um, this is our officer. He's in charge of X y Z. Um, if he spends most of his time up in the office, you know, that's fine, but it should be clear to the unit that he is serving a really good role. You know, you can't just say, Oh, we have an officer and you never talk about him. You never talk about his rules, his responsibilities. You know that's not good for the team because they don't develop a reporter with him. So I have to say, as an officer, he has a different rule than you guys. He's not down here working on equipment. He's not down here. Um, you know, cranking valves. I I want to say that because when I was coming up through the ranks, I didn't understand this difference. And I had a little resentment towards some of the officers that I saw was like, Hey, you know, we're down here sweating. We're busting our chops. How come I never see him? Um, now, as a chief, I make sure to explain that role toe the team toe to make sure that everyone understands everyone is working really hard. Um, and also explain the newest person you know, to the officer. Hey, you know what? Like even though he's just knew, you know, you have to realize, even though you don't see it, but he's down there in the build, getting his brand new uniformed dirty, you know, scrubbing and chipping and painting. You know, just to make sure that, you know, um, he's a valuable member of the team.

So, for instance, if there a chief, then maybe you're allowed to do that. But because there's that there's that line that if other people saw you and realize that you were friends, then they would have They wouldn't have the same opinion. I think that they can promote at the same rate as that other person. That's why you choose not to be friends with another person with a subordinate. Now that's not saying that you can't be friendly. Friendly is still trying to understand about their their life, their personality, their spouse, their kids, um, wanting to know that information. You know, it helps you smile. It helps the day go by it well, but you can't go over their house and play cards with them. You can't, uh, sit down with them at a bar and just drink. You know, the night away.

Their tons and tons of work hours to be had, Um when I when I got there, I think they were waking up in the morning and then they wouldn't get to bed until, like, 10 or 11 o'clock at night when I would get when I would, uh, finally tell him to break off for the night. And I think one of the issues was they didn't know how long it would last. Is this gonna be how all of deployment is gonna be? Is it? Are we gonna ever let up this weekend next month? When does it stop? If you had a plan about what things they're supposed to be completed and the amount of time they're supposed to take and you divided up in the equal portions and they could actually see what they're working on. Then they come in with a sense of saying, Hey, you know what? I'm gonna do this thing. And the longer I work, the closer I get to that goal.

Like we need you to do this, you're not doing it or we need you to do this. And you've been great at it. You know, you could just, like, filter out just fine.

No problem, Chief, With this new person, it's like why they have to do that. I was just up there three days ago, and I was up there last month. And how come you didn't choose? You know, joy over there, you know, he's not doing anything, so rather than, you know, say it the same way and have them be mad at you being up there possibly angry, you know, causing danger to themselves. You might have to, like, give them a little bit more explanation about why it is what Joey is doing. Um, there's a time for that, you know, explain what joy is doing. Uh, but it would help them understand their role and their position in the unit with mawr. Explanation.

However, if they say, um, Chief Anderson, this is your job and, um, its success or failure depends on you, then that actually puts ownership in my corner. And that makes me more accountable, because I know that if it's unsuccessful, it's not gonna go to him. That's something that you always have to think about as a leader.

Have military members do the things that you want than civilians? I think that there's a long there's there a lot of reasons for this number one because you're directly in charge off the military persons progression. Um, maybe you're not directly in charge, but you can control it. All you have to do is just tell is Chief. That's kind of like telling the mom or the dad of some kid versus a civilian, and that's more like dealing with a stranger. Number one. You have no idea who is boss is. If you do, maybe they're kind of separated. Uh, even if you did know him like because they're under government obligations, um, they can't really chastised the person under them the same way that a person in the military could. So it z not night and day, but because you're more involved in the leadership structure of the military person and you can affect them. Ah, lot more.

I'm not very familiar with them, but from what I've kind of seen is, I'm thinking of Let's say, March Air Force Base. I see lots of buildings all around, and I'm assuming that there's a floor for a department and there's, Ah, third floor for another department, and I bet that they don't interact as much. And I bet that that building that squadron doesn't interact as much with the squadron to squadron to the right. Compare that with the Navy when you take all of those buildings and all of those floors and stack them on top of each other. And now you have an aircraft carrier which has electrical division, mechanical division, the cooks, the boatswain's mates, and you always hear what everyone's doing all the time. This is the one EMC we'd like to think electrical division for fixing the mass. This is, uh, we'd like to thank the cooks for providing a good meal to everyone. We'd like to thank the boatswain's mates for guiding us through this treacherous territory. Um, we're all in this. We're all doing general quarters together. That means everyone has, um, firefighting pack on. And we're all seeing each other, talking to each other, seeing each other in the hallways, playing cards with each other during during galley mills. Um, you have a lot more interaction with the whole entire structure rather than being so split up. So I think that that navy it builds it builds community within your work center within your department within the entire ship. And I don't think that other military branches have that as much.",

So we all learn that we treated Listen, you know, that's the most important thing we all learned. To be fair, we all learned toe go up the correct chain of command.

I remember there was one time that my commanding officer, my officer in charge, was really chewing me out, you know? And there was another person, um, in other room who is listening on. And I guess I I think I let everybody leave, you know, um, and we still needed toe, have some things done. And I let him, you know, like, have his have his words with me, Um, and toward the end, because I just sat there, you know, with my hands behind my back. Yes, sir. No, sir. And very, very careful with my words. Um, so I see kind of realized like, yeah, maybe he's kind of pushing me, and I'm here to help him rather than hurt him. So the end of our conversation was Yes. I'll get right on that, sir. And then I finished it. And that person, he was a first class at the time, you know, he tapped me on the shoulder and said, Boy, you know, I've never seen something like that. And the way that you handled yourself was so impressive. I don't know. I could have done that. You know, I think most people that were in that position would have been very defensive and started, you know, going back and forth. Maybe he had an argument, would have had an argument. But that's not what I do. That's not how I roll. So I think once the commanding officer, you know, once he got his frustration with the unit out of the way, he said, You know what? This person can actually help me, um, put him on my team rather than attack him, and we actually got the work done. So that first class actually became a chief.

The vast majority of the time are really small things that we do that really, um, make the day to day operation run smoothly. We got to get people on their 80 s. We have to make sure that the training is up to date. We have to make sure that everyone has their medical.

Um, that's what we as chiefs tend to do most of the time, were moderators, right. Um, there could be two people arguing, and we're the type of people have to be the type of person that can come in and break up a fight.

In my experience, I had this experience, um, one of my friends he got busted for drunk driving. He was fined $10,000 and he got busted down one. And he was a good friend of mine. And this is what happened to him, X, y and Z, you know, So if you would have done this, it would have been better. Continue with your story.

Um, as it turns out right now, you know, you have a second class who's like, really, really knowledgeable. Um, they could be considered the leader. And when compared to, like another first class or chief in some cases like that, that second class could be right. That's because there's been, ah, big boosting knowledge recently. Um, we have the Internet. We have smarter people coming in. We have, ah, bigger, bigger pool of people to work with. So you can't just depend on your laurels anymore. You can't depend on your experience anymore. You actually have to look at the person and for me chewing out somebody. Um, just because I'm, uh, une seven and they did something wrong? Uh, that's that's not flying anymore, actually, have toe see why they are doing the whatever they're doing wrong. And then, um, adjust my leadership",

There should never be any loud voices unless it's laughter. Right. So when you hear someone saying that was my wrench or you're not supposed to go there or you're gonna get shocked, there's something like that. There's some kind of argument, you know, um, if you just hear that from the corner of Ah, here, You know, um, just walking around and you hear some loud noises, then obviously, you need to go and check it out. Another thing that could be a warning sign is silence. So the exact opposite of that if someone's just dead silent, obviously they might not wanna work with the person that they're gonna go work with. Or they could have had an issue, like earlier on in the day that you might wanna, like, figure out, um, those could be safety safety issues, right? If they don't wanna work together, so you need to figure out their loud voices or silent voices. Um, something might be amiss, could just be the personality. But in most cases, it's not",

But I think one tried and true trick is toe kind of take off your badge for a second. You know, pull the person over to the side and say, Just ask him. You know what's really going on? Um, you lay out the what you think are the issues, what you think are the problems. Well, you know what? Like you've been coming in late three times in a row. Um, you missed this assignment. Um, What's going on? And now they can correct you and say, it's not like that or they can give you the responses. It's up to you to decide whether the responses are correct or not. But you can attack those issues, right? And find out. Hey, it's actually a family issue or hey, it's actually, um, the fact that that person doesn't like another person in the unit, and they had an argument that you hadn't heard about. So you need toe. Um, step away from the chief aspect for a moment, because if you still have it on, it's like, Hey, I'm a chief. You need to tell me what's going on then. They're just gonna be just by the book. But if you want to get into their personality, if you want to get to the real reason that they're having the issue, you kind of talk to them as a person. You never truly give up your chief, Um, your chief rank. You know, they still they still maintain that distance. But you want to, um, let them know number one? You can be a friend to them. You know, that's what we're all supposed to be were employees. But we're also working together as compatriots, right? So get yourself in that friendly mode. You're not an officer. An officer.

But there are many situations that, um aside from safety, that you can kind of squeeze under the rug. If there's a person, that's, let's say, um Miss three, 33 three get togethers, three musters. And then, um he misses one more, and that that fourth one is gonna be the one that, you know, loses makes him lose his rank. You don't wanna have something so strict on him just yet. You want to understand the real reason if he's missing the fourth one? Obviously, you had a conversation, but maybe you haven't had a personal conversation yet. You have a chief or leader. You have to make that determination. You know, like, before I make some very drastic move on something really, really small. Uh, let's get a little bit more information about it. And, um, if the final explanation was good, like, oh, you know what? My car broke down. That's a good one. Um, the Navy has really strict policies like Well, you know, it's the fourth one. So regardless, no matter what? Then? You know you lose your rank. But as a chief, I can say you know what? Like I can understand that. You know what? Um, we're going to forget this one. I'm going to say you came in and we need to get your car fixed, you know, because the solution isn't actually correcting the problem. Um, the first three times, maybe he was just coming in just because he's lazy. But we already had that conversation. We already sat down and said, You know what? You're not gonna be lazy anymore. If you do it again, then you know, like the result is gonna come.

6149a9b2a8bc83022ac1786c,Tell me about a situation where your team and you had a major disagreement about how to handle something.,,"So as ah, reserve electrician's mate Chief, I recently went to the USS Blue Ridge. I was in the electrical department and I was in charge of this of a group of maybe I'm 15 electrician's who we were going through this really intense program. It's called unserved, and they hadn't been in chief there in the unit for a long time. So basically the, uh, second class in the first class classes that were there, they were actually running the unit. And to tell the truth, without a chief there, it had gotten a little out of hand. Um, there's a lot of gun decking going on. There's a lot of gun decking is when you say that you're supposed to do with some work, but you actually don't do it or you don't do it correctly or you don't do it completely. Um, there had been, uh, I guess lots of lots of team members like leaving throughout the day and then coming back later on, and you don't really know where they are, you know, chances are they could have been in Iraq. They could have been just walking around the ship or on the flight deck you know, not really working, You know, their mind and things like that going on. And they hadn't been corrected for a long time for for many months. You know, there's only one officer in the unit, and she couldn't really look at the whole entire unit. So when I once I came there, um, I have to correct those things. And so one of the things that I wanted to do was say, Well, we should write down all the things that we're gonna be doing with little boxes and and once they get complete, then we check the boxes off. And they were very adamant against that. At least the the first class and second class leadership that was there. Um, that's because that's kind of like going into their field. It's like, well, you know, micromanaging. But it's not micromanaging, you know, like I I I've done the same at my university. I've done the same with all of the other units that I've been with, you know, so and I think it really works. It really helps the leadership know exactly what's going to be accomplished. Tells a unit what we're expecting of them, and it allows us to keep track throughout the rest of the day. So I was pretty adamant about wanting to do that. And, um, the first class and second class is did not want to do that, just like we'll get it done at our own pace. Don't worry about it. New Chief. So that was Ah, point of conflict. Um, yeah. It was, uh, strong words there, and eventually it I had to go into the friend zone and try toe work with them as a team rather than this, you know, super strict, chief to get it done and eventually was done my way. But it didn't come without a price.",

I was a new chief there, and the unit was basically run by some of the younger 1st and 2nd class petty officers. We had some kind of conflict because, um, it was very lax in the unit, and I had to bring it up toe up to par. That being said, they they were being really, really overworked. And I think that's part of the reason that they were, um, being lax because there was no really strong figure toe view them. And when you come in, when you supposed to come in at seven o'clock and your going to Iraq around, like 10 or 11 every single day Saturdays and Sundays included, then of course, you know, if if no one's like, you know, happening you of your back, then you're gonna, like be easy. Nobody wants to work 12, 13, 14, 15 hours per day every single day, right. So, um, in order to get the unit toe where it needed to be, that's actually what they should have been doing that, that we had that schedule so we could make it on time. And, yeah, it required 13, 14, 15 hours per day. Um, but that's because they weren't working at 100% efficiency. They weren't even working at 60% efficiency, right? So the response to that was, we'll just keep working on harder, and I didn't want to do that. I actually wanted to make them more efficient, but also give them more time. So my goal was, Hey, you know what? Let's First of all, let's stop working them so hard, give them more reasonable hours. Once they see that we're giving them a little bit of more freedom. Hopefully then they'll up their game to, you know, So it's kind of like the chicken and egg. Uh, we're not gonna give them freedom until they start working harder. And I want to do the opposite. I want to give them freedom so that they could work harder. So that's where my issues and the and the units on the upper leaderships issues kind of conflicted. But we found a solution",
6149a9b2a8bc8356ebc1786e,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,Has this job ever made you feel insecure?|Do you sometimes have to take chances?|Is this dangerous?,"the risk of an electrician's generally depend on other people. You were working, um, in two pairs, right? So there could be a lot of times that, um, someone's working on some kind of electrical equipment, and you have to trust that they did their job correctly. You're putting your hands in some breakers, and you're not gonna have all the electrician's all check the same exact panel, right? So you just have to depend on them to do their job correctly s so that you don't get electrocuted. For the most part, I I didn't really trust too much that that's just a general, um, general thing with me, because I I've seen some some shady stuff in the past, and I just tend to not trust so much. But, uh, there's a point, you know, there's a point that, you know, what if they're all the panels are off and you're going inside? Hey, you know what? Like the person is not going to turn this thing on, right? The danger tags are all correctly written, right? Um, the person that actually read the tag correctly, right? Those are all trainings that we've had in the past. So You just have to assume that, um they read it correctly. They did their job correctly. Uh, they're gonna operate the equipment correctly. And now you are, uh, piggybacking off of that and and continue the work based on what they did.",

The electrician's mate means that I'm an expert, um, for electrical operations for electrical maintenance. Um, I think that I can handle that pretty well. I'm a chief, which means that, um, I handle the unit. I handle the operations that we do the minutes that we do, but also, um, the day to day, um, activities. So if they need training, um, if they need other things like that Now, what I'm not an expert in is anything outside of that. So, for instance, security. You put it up to the security manager, Um, let the experts do their job and specifically sexual things. Um, um, emotional things for the sexual part. We have the victim's advocate. We have the, uh, sexual assault coordinator. Um, you refer your people to them for the psychological. We have the psychological health operation specialists. You referred to them, you know, like things dealing with suicide as soon as you hear it. Um, that that someone might be considering that. Say, Well, you know, as a chief, that's where my role ends. You know, he's in my unit. My goal from that point on is to make sure that that person is safe because as electrician's, you know, safety is number one always on my mind and then get that person to the correct, um, psychological health outreach person. So, um yeah, other than the obvious ones, it's a case by case thing. Um, if people are belligerent, you have to realize, like whether you can handle that in house or if you have to send that up to the to the MPs, um, think things like that.",

Anyways, you just realize that's the way that it is. It's always been like that at every single command that have had. Um, it's even like that in the civilian world. So number one don't take it to heart. No one's gonna be blaming U. S. Oh, that's wrong. They will blame you, Right? But in the end, everyone realizes that you're human as well. And especially the officers they can kind of see whether it's your fault or not. You know, like as a chief, you could say, Well, we didn't get this maintenance done. Um, it's up on. The folks will super, far, far in the front. And I've been in the galley in the kitchen all day with this 111 thing the officer can say, Well, you know what? The folks of things should have been done. And it's your fault, Chief. And the wrong answer is to say, it's not my fault. I wasn't there. No chief will ever answer that way. The correct response is well the officer is not actually blaming me. He's the one who sent me to the galley to fix things, but it's his responsibility to make sure that it gets done. And he hasn't put some blame somewhere, right, because you know, it wasn't correct. So the blame has to go somewhere. But he's not blaming me. He's not blaming me. The chiefly leader, right? Um, s o just accept the fact that the thing wasn't done and then find out where the blame should be. Should be focused, right? And then creek that that problem. But don't take it to heart. Don't take the complaints against you, Toe heart. If it is your fault, then of course, fess up to it, you know? But if it's not your fault, don't place the blame in other places.

The military side is when you're very, um, very by the book, you explain what happened. You don't go past what happened, right? You explain to the family, um, exactly the situations around. But whatever happened with that family member, you know, you know, that's kind of by the books, Um, and then you have to put on your personal side. You know what? If you knew the person, then you know, as as a friend, as a fellow worker, that's a fellow human being, you know, this is what I thought of them. This is what the unit thought of them. Um, take heart realized that that the person served pretty well in the military. You know that. That's an honorable thing.

I left the Navy the active duty Navy, because I wanted to have ah, college career at the school of my choice, studying what I wanted to. And that really wasn't a Knop shin for me When I was in the military, they wanted me to study nuclear engineering at a certain school, um, in a certain part of the country and actually wanted to do something different. I'm still in the Navy, you know, part time. But it's not, you know, active duty. Um, another reason is that people would leave the military is because it's not designed for them. You know, we try to snuff those people out during boot camp, but we don't get everyone. Um, you still have people who are just, um uh, complainers who are aren't good workers who don't work well with other people in in teams. Eso those kinds of things, they actually come out when you're working for the 2nd and 3rd and 4th year. And to tell you truth, it will probably be the best interest of the Navy that they're not there. That's a safety issue, or that's an efficiency issue. Um, so it's better to get those people out so they don't want to be here and to tell the truth, like the Navy confined other people that can replace them. Eso people that don't wanna be here, people that wanna a different career for wanna go to college. Um, maybe this was just, um, to set themselves up in life. Like even if I didn't want to go to college, I would still probably thank the Navy for the skills that they gave me and then continue on toe like a higher paying job in the outside world. And there's places for people like that. In fact, the Navy actually came up with a new retirement system called the Blended Retirement System, which, um, is focusing on the people who know that they're not gonna have a 20 year career. Um, for the people that are gonna be in for 46 years, they say, Hey, you know what? We'll set you up with your life. You be a veteran, you get these experiences, you conserve the country and thank you for being on our ship. In the end, we'll give you the Montgomery G. I. Bill or the post 9 11 bill. A zit is now and we'll give you some cash. Um, for your retirement that you can use later on. So it depends on what you want.

The person who's opening the breaker to see how he's doing it in the morning, at least for Electrician's. They're going to say, Well, we're going to do X Y. And we're also going to use this crazy weird, um, maintenance item. Now you're not gonna be tasked with doing all of that stuff, right? Um, but if they say, hey, you know what, That crazy weird item I've never done that before. You might want to take it upon yourself to do your task and then go check that thing out A T end.

There'd be sometimes when I'm when I was a second class or third class and we look at some of the Chiefs and you know they're around big guys, you know? And although they're very well respected, obviously, you know, they became chiefs and and, you know, we go to them all the time for our problems. Uh, in the back of our minds were just thinking, Well, why isn't this person in shape that's always at the back of our minds? As a leader, you have to be the role model. You have to be in the top 10% of all the runners. You have to be the guy cheering people on. You can't be the guy that people are worried about, right? Um, even even though if it might be true, obviously everybody can have their own problems and stuff, you know. But when you're projecting your leadership on other people, they have to be the lower ones and going up to you, and it hasn't always be that way. Um, maintain your military bearing, right, Uh, for any of the chiefs that that that I've seen that were wrinkled or creased or something like that, um, you're always gonna compare them to the hot shot first class that that's there, and you're gonna make that comparison and you never wanna be underneath. Ah, first class. Uh, if you if you're a chief for above, um, if you have a hot shot, then you have to be a hotshot to they have to see like, Hey, you know what? That chief is the one who made that first class be that way. So, um, a Sfar is your physicality ous faras your uniforms assed faras your speech as far as your connection, whether the people, as far as your quickness to anger all of those, have to be, um, at the at the top of their game. And I know it's a lot, but you're gonna have many years to prepare many years to practice, And they're gonna be other chiefs out there who wanna make sure that, um, all your tiny little problems, um, are chipped away, edged away at until you're a military model of a leader",

My mother wasn't working to regularly. My my sister was on welfare and she had three kids of her own. And, um, yeah, I didn't have all the basic necessities. It didn't really bother me too much because, like, I didn't feel like I needed, um, many things, But yeah, we didn't have a car most of the time riding around on the bus on many occasions, didn't have enough money for, um, for paying for things that school food was basically free. You know, I don't think that I ever wanted for food. I just didn't eat that much. So I wasn't that hungry. School was in the morning, and at night time we had enough, um, food on the table, so that wasn't a big problem. But it's more for things that make you a better person through life, For instance, like having enough money toe go to the theater or having some cash for your local comic book. You know, I didn't have those those type of things. Um, Christmas time was, uh, they give you some gloves, and that was among some other things. You know, they they tried and not gonna complain. You know, I had a good life. I had a loving family, so I'm not gonna push that too hard. But your basic material things was something that I think would have given me a bit a better or a different perspective. Uh, coming up through the, uh, through the years, I was young, um, and obviously, like, growing up like this By the time I let's say, got to the navy, I don't think that I had a very strong work ethic. I did come and I did learn I was in the nuclear propulsion field and I think someone who had a different lifestyle, for instance, you know, they had their standard 1300 s a t know that their tutors coming coming through it. Not all of them were like that, but just a few. I think that they probably had, ah, better a better quality of education while they were through the program. Whereas for me, you know, I Yeah, sure. I read the book sometimes, and I tried to understand as much as I could, but I didn't have the basic electron ICS to give me that preparation. You know, I didn't know what a ground was. I I barely knew what current was like. I had to understand everything from the very, very beginning. When I think some of those things I should have gotten through public education through the books, I would have read if I would have been a good student or through the training, I would have gotten, you know, had I been a better student in school. Um, so the good thing about the Navy is they do start you off on on an even playing field like you. We expect that you know nothing. They expected people like me, which was which was excellent.

And that's taking ownership of whatever it is that you're doing, especially in new school. You actually have toe go to the library, get the steam propulsion manual and start reading, you know, left and right. You don't know something's And yeah, you have some access to other people who know where the material is, But they actually like force you to do a lot of research on your on your own to do the homework on your own. I don't think Yeah, After you start getting a certain G p a like 3.8 Onda above which I had, they don't even expect you to do homework. They just have the tests and say here, you know, you you study night and day Do do baby sit you, um, in a school toe degree. So, for instance, if you're not doing well, you know, you have, like, less than three point? No. Then you have an extra 20 to 40 hours extra that they expect from you. I'm I'm assuming that other, um, eight schools are similar, but maybe not that intense. You know, maybe the material isn't quite as dense, but, um, they do hold your hand through the education. You only have yourself to blame if you don't go through that. But after the two years of a school, uh, then they let you free. You're free to go and especially nukes. They expect you toe, you know, be smart to accept the training. Some of its really dense and you, you know, way above your grade. Your pay grade. So, um, especially the first year, too. They're talking about the top of the, um, aircraft carried all the way to the bottom, to the left and right. And, you know, the electrons that go into it, the things that they need to purchase and how the Cellini cell works on the inside. And, you know some of those things you you barely glossed over in a school. But now they're giving you an in depth, um, rundown of each thing and it, you know, it just goes over your head. But the fortunate thing is, you don't have to memorize those things. I think a lot of it is just they just want you to have some experience with it. And after two years or three years, then you become a pro. And there's this, like path that you're supposed toe, you know, adhere to the whole entire time for you to become that pro. Um, so when you're going through it at the at the very, very beginning, you're you're not sure about how much you're supposed toe ingest. Technically, you could spend all watch just reading all books, which is what they expect you to do, which is what they tell you to dio, um, you could spend, um, you know, hours after your eight hour workday just still reading and still not read enough. You know, it's an infinite amount of material that should be covered. That's gonna help you get promoted on the test. You know, the higher your score like, let's say, um, you score really well and then you will be promoted based on, like the percentage that you score above other people. So, yeah, the cool thing is, there's a there's a range for everyone. So if you don't score pretty well, then you know you get promoted a little bit slower. And if you do, um, just read nonstop constantly, then their path for you to become an officer toe get promoted early. So, um yeah, As long as you take ownership of yourself, then I think that that's probably one of the most challenging things that you have is a military person in the new field.",

I I was putting forth my full effort every single weekend or maybe every other weekend. You know, depending you'd have some test on Monday. And I remember just not really understanding all the new material that that that week and just being totally confused. But I remember just going in as soon as Friday. The bell hit, you know, just stand at the library. Read, read, read. Going dinner. Come back, read, read until they kick you out, I think midnight or something. Um, Saturday was, you know, you wake up in the morning, maybe you exercise. Maybe you like, uh, eat some breakfast, and then you go in and you're there until midnight. You don't go anywhere else. Um, that Saturday was full of white boards and writing paper until my finger had, like, calluses on it. And then the Sunday would, um, would be more like, you know, review of what I did. I probably teach other people and that actually helped myself. Um, pretty much the whole day. And I wouldn't go home until I was sure that I would get a four point on the next test. Um, I think I got a four point at once, but the point is that I was I was confident in all of my answers. Um, So I did that for two years because to tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in the in nuclear propulsion actually want to be a cryptologist. But I heard that this program, which I wasn't familiar with it had lots of math and science, and he transferred fluid flow in chemistry. It had all of that. And I thought that that would be a really good way Thio cover those things that I didn't in high school and prepared before the, you know, the intensive Naval Academy. So at at that two year point when I applied, I was, you know, had a really high G p a. I had a pretty good recommendations from all of my officers. Um, it came back, rejected, and I was actually surprised. Um, later on, the x o of the academy called me out of the blue I was studying, you know, kind of like, you know, like, um frustrated. And he called me and he said, Hey, you know, like, um, I just want to let you know, Like we saw your, uh, your application and, you know, we have some chit chat, and he said, Well, you know what? Like I think I'm gonna send you to boost, you know, because like, you're an excellent candidate, by the way, Um and then I told him I'm sorry. I'm, uh, past the age. I was 22 but I would would have been 23 by the time. And that's the cut off. And, you know, that was that was surprising to him. You know, I think it was prepared to like Cindy, and and he said, Well, what's honestly, you know, what was the case? Why did you choose your major? So he basically told me why I was rejected. I actually chose economics instead of engineering. Um, Major And I told him that, you know, I think I give some answer that I wanted to, like, learn languages. And I didn't think that it really mattered what major you did as long as you know, like you're gonna just learn leadership and other, um, military qualities at the academy. And he said, Yeah, actually, were we expect engineers, uh, you know, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering. You know, those those are the main ones that we wanted. So, yeah, we parted ways and I didn't get accepted. And that that was first time I've ever, ever really tried something other than tracking cross country in high school. But, um, academically, that's the first time I've ever put forth my full effort at something and then didn't get accepted. That's my biggest failure.",

When I tried to apply it to the Naval Academy and didn't get accepted, I think another failure that I had, at least, um, academically is when I was at Berkeley and I didn't go home and read all the chapters. You know, they say, like, this is how you succeed, you know, read this and do this, you know? And I didn't really push myself as hard as I should have. And that lasted my whole career. Sometimes I did. You know, sometimes I was, you know, during the weekend, I just like reading, reading code and code. But other weekends, I just, you know, like I got a C or a B on a test. And, you know, like, I feel like, Hey, you know what? I should have really pushed myself a little bit harder during that time. But the failures that I have currently are the ones that are that I'm most unhappy with Andi. This means as a chief, um, you have people under you and I I felt them all the time. I try it. You know my hardest. I tryto get them awards and they don't get accepted for I try to get them promoted and they don't get, um, the the credit that they that they want. I try to write the most fair evaluation that I that I can and some of the ones that have the lower ones, you know, I have to explain. And then they walked out the room and I say, Hey, how did you try to change him? Did you try to get that? You know that three point. Oh, upto a four point. Oh, Did you give them all the tools that were necessary so he could succeed? And yeah, this is constant.

But for the most part, looking at the thing that they're asking you to do and then seeing the result from my experience, it seems that most of the time they asked you to do reasonable things in a reasonable, reasonable amount of time. Um, if they say you know what we need, Um, you need to do preventive maintenance on this pump on DWI. Give you like, two days for this. There's almost no excuse for why you can't do it, of course, like let's say you break your leg or let's say you open it up and there's a wrench in there that you have to do something else Thio, you know, like get it out. You know they're those exceptions, But, um, aside from exceptions, the Navy is really good, you know, in the in the top 99 percentile of asking you to do Onley things that you can do. And I think that it's your job that if you cannot do the job in the requested amount of time, it's your responsibility and we train you on this that you have to tell them before. So that means with those two things, A. We're giving you a reasonable amount of things to do and be You should tell us beforehand if it ever gets to the point where it's the end and you say I'm sorry it didn't happen.

I was the chief, the new chief in charge of making sure that we successfully passed our insert requirement in service. I mean, it's ah really comprehensive test that all the departments of the ship have to pass. And as a new chief, I was I was supposed Thio get all the electrician's to do all of the jobs that they were supposed to, and I think that they were very, very far behind. That's one of the reasons that I was called there and, uh, we didn't do too well. I think we scored in the mid range and the most of the ship. They passed pretty pretty well, either green or, you know, like slightly under. But our electrical division was just so so in that. In that respect, I think that we were working really hard every single day. Um, warning tonight. You know, uh, kind of directing some of the guys toe, go fix things and do preventive maintenance on things. However, we couldn't catch up from the like maybe year. That had been kind of like slowly keeping behind us. There were too many things to fix. Too many lights that we hadn't seen too many rooms that we didn't know where they were too many like bakers that we couldn't open once they were open, like inside. We have to, like, do some other things to make it work properly. And we couldn't catch up, Um, to the time, um, that insert was to be successful in that regard. Who did I talk to? You know, uh, that's the thing. You always have to have feedback to the people above you, your superiors, your devo, Um, even the commanding officer in this case, you know, I remember the commanding officer of the Blue Ridge was down with us down in the in the aft steering room. Um, making sure that the the I think it was some kind of valve that was supposed to be, um, that was affecting the engine room. He was there, you know, like turning a wrench with us. So as long as everyone up the chain knows exactly where you are and what your problems are than they're a little bit more forgiving for that, it's when you try to hide things. And, you know, you say, like, Hey, I could do it. You know, I'm a single individual or I'm the leader of this crew, you know, And you don't feed the information back up the chain.

I think most people who are chiefs would say the time that they became a chief the time that they got accepted. But I would say that it actually came a few years before that when I when I made first class. Uh, that's the time that I think I've been in for maybe six years. And I had recently had a bolt in the road where I didn't get accepted. I missed the first class exam by, like, 60.1%. Um, uh, yeah, it is very, very close, you know, like anything, if I would have gotten an award or like maybe one more point on my evil, anything would have would have bump me up to the to the next rank. So by that next time actually took a weekend, um, and study for the exam. It's the first time that I did, and I remember going through the books, seeing like what you're supposed to study and like circling things and like on a sheet of paper, you know, like, um, writing down things that that I needed to memorize. It's kind of like a nuclear power school. I think I spent, like, eight hours per day. Um, for those three days. And then by the time I got the the recommendation, I think I scored in the top 99% of nuclear propulsion engineers, and I kind of saw you know what? Like the power of self studying, it actually really does. Guide, um, your progress. And I think I still hold on to that. I now, based on what I did and the amount of effort that the the positive result that I saw for myself, I can now confidently tell my other people Hey, you know, if you study, you will most likely see success. And I mean that instead of just, like, maybe, uh, chit chat from other people who maybe haven't studied, but just kind of say like, Hey, you know what it za right thing to do.

Um, once you stop becoming Anak, did you remember and you switch over from a nuke to a regular electrician's, Then you're dealing with things that you have never seen before and some of it's great. Um, I actually put armatures in for motor before I've never done that. I've actually, like dipped huge pieces of mechanics, uh, mechanical pieces. I've actually ran cables. I've taken out entire circuit breakers with civilians, you know, like all these things I've never seen before and and it really build your, um, build your experience. But the shipyards superintendent, though that's, um, after eight years of doing the reserve and doing electrical things, you know, things that I kind of knew about.

You have to go to the the main deck and the quarterdeck and, uh, you know, like fixing walls and paint. And, uh, like there's so many things that I had no idea about, and yet I had to learn at the time. And for shipyard superintendents, they don't really have a tutor in front of you. You actually have to, like, just hop in there and just start learning, you know, like asking people, What is this? What is that? You know, reading computer drawings and books. And it was it was pretty intense. But, you know, you step up to the challenge and luckily you have a good support network there. I didn't know about that, but I didn't realize how how good it was.

Another chief friend of mine based on doing those things. And you're around it all the time. Um, but in those cases they give you and you're supposed to use all the protective equipment that is necessary to do the job successfully and safely. Um, so I would say the mawr dangerous electrical work I've done, uh, the more safe I've been. Ironically, it's when you start going lower down the line of risk that your danger actually increases. Um, the most dangerous thing I've done is just being around the propulsion plant, Um, and not putting in your in your hearing protection. You know, you do that for a couple of a couple of months, and then all of a sudden, you know, you start hearing ringing in your ears, that Z, that's actually pretty dangerous. That's not something that civilians are normally exposed to. you know. So it's something simple. Like just wearing your PPE is, uh, is probably the most dangerous I would feel. But, like physically the most like on a day basis, the most dangerous thing I've done is probably, um, go up to the top of one of the light mass. We have to change the transistor eyes, me and another guy and you Absolutely, where? The crack material.

Hey, took me thio these two boxes and for most of the maintenance requirement courage, it takes one person to kind of look, um, maybe be a safety observer and explain things and another person actually be in the in the in the equipment. And in order to do any maintenance down in the nuclear power plants, there's a long process. You have to get permission from the watch officer. You have to hang danger tags. You have to have another person go around and look at the danger tags you have tow. You know, say that you're ready to work. You have to go down to the plant and actually like, set up the proper equipment. You know, there, we try to make it a safe. It's possible.

I'm gonna check every single breaker, every single tag. I'm always gonna look read every single instruction because I don't trust anyone at that time. And that was wrong.

However, if I wanna be, say, a command master chief, then there might not be a role like that, except for a few states. So I have to be very selective in which state I choose. Um, so obviously third class petty officer, you have your watch stations that you're qualified for. You have all the training that you've done, and you have a wide range of places that you can go. Um it also depends on the needs of the Navy, but for the most part, you have more choices. But as you grow up as you grow in your leadership responsibilities, they become more and more singular.

And, uh, while I'm driving around in my eclipse, they're getting all the girls and going to all the parties and stuff in there. They're beautiful car, so I think they probably think it's worth it.

Just live off of 50,000 and then split that up by months. And then that's the life that you can afford. So budgeting is really, really useful. I personally didn't need a budget, because I, um I lived as cheap as possible. And I just knew, You know, like, I have a $5000 check coming in every month and I live off of 1000 maybe $2000 per month then, um, yeah, all the rest of this goes and savings, but I know a lot of people aren't aren't like that.

You always keep your home of record. My home of record is California, which means that I'll be a California resident no matter where I am. But for instance, when I was in Washington, Washington doesn't require state taxes, so there's a way that you can still be a California resident. But you signed the paperwork so that your ah, Washington resident, which means that you don't have to pay state taxes and California is your home of record. So you still get the benefits of still being associated with California. You could go to the all the universities, uh, that you want to You could get, uh, you could go to State college and still have all all that access.

For some people, um, it depends on what it is they're grieving over eso. If you keep their mind on their work without delving too much on what it is that they're grieving about, that could help. Um, what's ah, better tactic is to get it out in the open and see if they need to be taking off the ship or assigned to a different job. That, like, let's say, this job is kind of dangerous. If they keep performing it, um, you could send them toe something that's like, let's say, going to the library and helping people there. There they have a little bit more timeto think about, um, the thing that's causing them trouble without putting other people's lives in jeopardy. Um, uh, one of the last result resource is, is toe.

So, for instance, if the person hurts themselves if they heard another person, um, if they're very, very violent, if they say, um yeah, particularly terrible things, For instance, um, you know I want to hurt myself. Uh, then you at least want to document it so that where that you or whether somebody that comes after you, who's who's not familiar with the situation, there's at least a track s so that we can either look at the past history and make a determination on what we should do with the person or someone who's not.

6149b38ca8bc832487c18e7b,What do you do to avoid bias when evaluating sailors?,,"the way that I tend to avoid bias is number one by giving constant feedback. Um, a case in in point is, um, I'm supposed to give evaluations for, um, several people in the unit. Let's say they're 20 people. Um, at the beginning of the cycle, um, I tell them exactly what I expect for them. Toe earn the wars that they're gonna get. Earn the marks that they're gonna get. Um, I make sure during the midterm counseling, I sit them down. I give them a sheet of paper that describes how generally, um, grade them. Um, maybe not always with the direct marks, but I tell them where their strengths are, where their weaknesses are and what I expect them to do. Um, in the next six months, to kind of increase their scores. Um, and especially during counseling, I, um, make sure that I put everyone's, um I put everybody on on an Excel sheet, and I have, like, all of the roles, like professional development leadership, um, can, uh, climate inequality. I put all of those down, and then I mark exactly based on what they wrote on the back of their evaluation, how they increased each of those scores and I go through everyone. I make sure that, like if I gave somebody a good score, that someone who did the same exact thing gets that same score, a zealous for the negatives. And then, um, I think that that's how I prevent bias in my own grading That goes the same for awards if I'm handing out awards or if I'm giving promotions.",

If you've been, uh, in the unit a lot, you kind of know if the mood changes after there's been some kind of discrimination or assault or things that could really affect the unit, Um, you might notice a difference in the mood or the tone of the unit. And that might let you know that Hey, you know what? 20 minutes ago, there was probably a big argument. I found that a lot on my last ship. Um, sometimes I would go inside and everyone's eating pizza and kind of chatting and joking around. Another time I would go in and everyone's rocking in their chairs. Or it's just sitting down like staring at the walls and stuff. You know, something kind of happened eso If the mood changes, that's one. If you see a decrease in the quality of work, that's another one. Um, especially if a really good person who never has any problems starts handing and shoddy work.

6149b38ca8bc838e7ec18e7d,Can you date while on a ship?,,"there are local rules that inform you, um, how you can date? What's general is that you can't fat in eyes, which means that if you're in a supervisory position, you can't, um, date someone underneath you. So there are exceptions. So, for instance, let's say your first class can you date second classes. Well, it might depend on whether that second classes, um, on a different, um, like like a part of a different um, unit. Then you can tow Electrician's date. Well, if ah, first classes in, uh, reactor room one and the second classes in reactor room to even though they're a part of the same electrical division, maybe they can date. So, um, that that that's a little bit more flexible. Um, what's not flexible is, for instance, if you're a chief, you can't really date people underneath you, so they actually have to get off the off the ship. Um, if you're an officer, you also can't date, um, enlisted people. Um, maybe officers can date each other, but for instance, they have to be separate. Basically, the rule is, um, within the chain of command. Nobody can, uh, anyone up the chain of command or below the chain of command.

Yellow is somewhere in the middle and green, I think, happens fairly often. And the reason for, uh, slight sexual comments throughout the work days Because, especially on deployment, you know, you're with everyone all the time. Um, from sunup to sundown. Um, you have guys and girls and they have their emotions. They have their feelings. And some people, actually, I think the military isn't is a wonderful place toe. Meet a spouse. There are many military couples. And without, like, talking to each other during work house, are you gonna get to know the other person?

Um, once we get out of work, for instance. I see them outside. I could maybe get their number at work, and then we take it further outside of work. Um, if you're on deployment, you don't have that opportunity. Uh, everything that you do, you know, if you're gonna talk to them, it's going to be at work because you're at work for 24 hours per day. Uh, the most important part of the most important thing to remember is that it cannot exist on this ship. There is no dating. There is no getting together. There's no kissing and hugging on this ship at all. Um, so, yeah, you can get to know people. You can sit down, chat, talk, talk about the general quarters that happen, talk about like when we get off the ship, you know, like like let's continue this further.

Um, make sure that, um, there other people around so that they will be less apt to kind of get together. You wanna keep people separate? Um, another place, obviously. Wherever there's alcohol involved, you know, bars and clubs. So whenever you pull into port, I make sure toe describe to people Hey, you know what? We're all together on the same team. Make sure that you don't get too touchy feely out there even though, like you've been working with this person for the last, like, a few months together, and you might have stronger feelings. Um, for them, compared to strangers, make sure that they don't get out of hand once whenever you pull into ports. Also, like whenever we're doing counseling. As a supervisor, I make sure that I always have the door open. Um whenever I'm doing like one on one counseling, or that there is a third person in the room thin, the door could be shut.

If it's banned by the Navy, then I ban it. If it's not, if it's allowed by the Navy, then I allow it. Um, there are some exceptions. So, for instance, let's say we have a sailor who just got a red badge or yellow badge. You know, they got caught drinking. They got caught staying out after curfew. And the Navy has these rules like, Hey, you know what? Like now, you're not supposed to be out after 11 o'clock. In those cases, I'm a little bit mawr, um, more strict with them. I say, Hey, you know what? Like if you get caught past caught, if you get caught out past 11 o'clock in, the name is going to do this. So I suggest I strong suggest that you make it here by 10 o'clock. Eso That's like a personal thing that I do because I don't want them to ruin their career. You know, like if you're really strict on the line and you know, even even if you're over like past two minutes, you know there's no there's no remorse for those guys, you know, and I know that those rules could be, like, really strict like that. You know, you could be, uh, going to jail for bread and water with bread and water. You know, I I don't wanna see anyone in those situations. So I give them a buffer to help them with their careers. So that, like, if they do go past my band, um, I don't have toe follow the Navy's rules.

Uh, you have to realize that the Navy changes all the time. There is No, um, there's always a right and wrong, especially like, based on guidelines. But that right and wrong changes with time. Um, for instance, you know, really, a long time ago there was a separate. They were separate, paid between blacks and whites. And now there's not so laws can change and temperaments can change and emotions can change, and the navy changes accordingly. Um, I know that when I when I first joined, um, there weren't that many transsexuals in the Navy and the people that are that were in the Navy had a strong had strong opinions about that. Those same people. I'm still one of them, right? They have to realize that we made rules for them, And some people just don't wanna change their minds so so drastically. They still have their their opinions about the way that it used to be. So, um, your whole goal as a supervisor is to get those people informed about the new rules about like how they have to change about how their career might be in jeopardy if they don't make that change. Um, another another one is PTSD, you know, like we had our opinions about that. Maybe we thought that those people, um, were violent and aggressive, and they don't deserve to have the same, um, resource is that other people had. Now we realize that it deals with mental health, and we should think of it as think, Think of their situation, mawr in a kind of light. Let's say so.

Um, that's perfectly fine. And you want them to change, Um, there step that you could take the first one. Especially as a supervisor. You go up to them, explain exactly what they're doing. That's wrong. Um, you know, tap on the shoulder, hopefully in a friendly way. Um, t try to change your mind if you see it re occur. That's when you have the direct counseling. Um, maybe it's another verbal counseling, but you make sure that, you know, they're saying they're seeing their seated in a chair and the third person is there, and, um, they know exactly what you said. Um, they know what they need to change. Another type of counseling is a written counseling. You know, you put in the record, you say, Hey, you know what? Like now something's gonna happen if you do this, then I have it written down that these things are gonna change. Um, so yeah, just as the supervisor, make sure that the steps are included on that, they know exactly what they need to change",

Uh, anything that's violent and anything that's, um, that sexual beyond the point of just words, um, and even depends on how bad the words are. Um, also racial things.

If you're un deployment, um, obviously is going to change. Uh, especially when you're talking about, like, who can get a hotel with whom and what policies They're gonna be in place like when you're in isolated areas on the ship when you're back at home. Uh, the main thing that you have to worry about is fraternization within, within the units and between the people on the ship when you're outside of base. Then, um, like I tend to let them live their civilian lives. Just make sure that you uphold the Navy's core values. Honor, courage and commitment. Don't touch anyone that you're not supposed to. Uh, maybe keep your words, um, respectable, especially when you're going up the chain. You know when you're talking to officers out out in the in the streets.

6149b38ca8bc836515c18e88,When is a formal report necessary for a harassment or sexual assault claim?,,"in the Navy, we tend to have three distinct groupings of sexual assault. Sexual harassment, Um, for the green light that tend, those tend to be like a words that you can say to another person. Um, hey, sexy. Hey, sweetie. Things that are a little bit above friendliness, um, that the other person might feel uncomfortable with, or maybe even another person a third person might feel uncomfortable with those could be green light. That's when a supervisor goes to the, um to the parties and kind of squashes it either the offending party and say, Hey, you know what? You shouldn't say those words. Or you could go to the person who was spoken to and say, Hey, um, this'd what I noticed. Um, are are you comfortable with that? And kind of, uh, like, ease the situation there just through words. Yellow light can be a little bit more, um, more intense. That could be slight touching, maybe grabbing the shoulders and and rubbing or, um, patting people on the but especially between, like after sporting events, you know those type of Pat's, um, when there is touching involved, you have to make sure that like the person who was touched doesn't feel that that action was sexual. However, it can be classified sexual, um, based on another person's viewpoint or even if you noticed it yourself. You know, like if you were offended by it, or you have some questions concerning it thin that could be yellow, regardless of whether either of the two parties thought it was sexual or not. Um, but yeah, touching and especially words like, you know, like more serious words Like, uh, I want to do this to the to you Or I think, uh, you know, we should go to this place, you know, like it's a It could be pretty pretty bad. That's in that sense. Red light is definite touching. Um, maybe on private sections, um, lower lower extremities, uh, maybe grabbing long grabs, maybe constant stairs, a certain a certain place, which obviously has sexual overtones on those for those cases. You definitely have to bring those up to a supervisor and get it documented.",

You know, try to get some kind of, um, some kind of basis for bringing it up to the highest level toe a higher level, something. They're pretty obvious, you know, if something, you know, egregious happens, I might just go straight to my to my supervisor and explain what happened. For the most part, if someone has, um, something bad happened to them, Uh, they're generally not supposed to come to me. We give a lot of training explaining who you're supposed to go to. We have posters everywhere. We have websites that you could go to. We have, you know, training very, very often. Uh, that describes that, um, someone who thinks something bad happened to them. Go to the va, the victim's advocate or the SAARC, and they can give them expert opinion about what they should do.",
6149b38ca8bc8329d4c18e8a,Who is the first things to do if someone tells you about a sexual assault?,,"one of the very first things I try to do is, um, get enough information so that I don't change the the basis of the report. Um, I would like to know if they would like to report it. That's one of the main ones I would like to know if they need medical help or assistance. That's another one. Um, I'd like to know if they if they are just doing fine in general. You know, I don't want, uh, like, send them off in the world, um, crying or, you know, possibly even suicidal without getting some kind of like a connection. Because if they came to me, then obviously they want to talk to me. Maybe they think, um, my words can kind of see them Or that I can direct them to the right location. And I'll I don't wanna send them off without understanding enough about the situation so that I'm doing it correctly.

I'm not really supposed to be involved in those types of things. I definitely don't want Thio have some kind of say in the promotion, um, the wards, the career progression of either of the two. So that's something that you wanna actually separate yourself from as much as possible for lower level things. You know, like quick things. Yeah, you can handle it on the lowest level possible. But if it's enough for me to think you know what this needs expert, it needs an expert opinion. I'll be the first person to go to the VA or the Stark",
6149b38ca8bc834078c18e8c,"What resources really help to prevent harassment or assault, in your experience?",,"I tend to find the annual training that we get on sexual assault prevention and response. Um, to be particularly valuable there a lot of definitions that aren't really common because we don't talk about them. Um, so much that the training provides useful information on what is the V A What is the SAARC? What medical facilities do you have available to you? Um, should police be involved. Who is that? Who is in your chain of command, who you can talk to about? About that? All of these things, um, they're experts on there are people who are experts on it, and they could give much better information on it. And we should just have general knowledge on on how we can direct those people to go to it. So annual trainings are really good.",

Resource is that you have, um, that you can take advantage of, uh, one would be the chaplain. Um, it could be your spiritual advisor. They could give you some kind words and make you think about life positively, um, regarding your case, Uh, regarding a case. There's the victim's advocate who's more in an administrative role. They can tell you what resources are available. Um, what things can be charged on, What type of charge There there it will be, whether it's gonna be, um, restricted or unrestricted. And the SAARC also plays a role in that as well. They have, um, lots of knowledge available to them that they can share with you. Um, if they're one of the first people that you go to if you've been, um, uh, if you have a sexual assault case that you want to talk about, um, a swell as the medical field, you could go toe doctors and nurses and your local hospital, and they can explain what things that they will provide if you've been attacked or assaulted",

What is a typical path?,can I impact how soon I get advanced?|how do you get promoted?|how does advancement work?|is it common to be promoted?,"foreign electrician's for active duty. You tend to do your first two years of school. That includes electrical training and learning about how the nuclear, uh, nuclear reactor works on how to become an operated for it. Um, the next four years should be spent on a ship. Now, that's just basically, uh, understanding how to do the technical aspect of it. Um, you're gonna be, uh, third class petty officer, second class petty officer, um, down there in the plants, Um, sometimes in the bills sometimes, um, working in, uh, in close operating station with, uh, watch upside down That's down there sometimes just going from level to level level, um, looking at pumps and valves and gauges. And, uh, you know, the fixing things, doing preventive maintenance after you become a first class petty officer, then you've done that for the most part, and you're kind of supervising people. Um, you do that for about a couple of years, So you're at about your eight year mark, maybe even nine year mark, that you've been doing that Not only have you been a first class petty officer who who's been training people, but you've also had other experiences you've been maybe the training pitch officer, which, um, has a job of showing people all of the tech manuals and what's inside the tech manuals and how to read things from the tech manuals and doing power power Point presentations on some equipment that they've never seen before. You know, that's when you kind of like extend, um, how our extended learning that we've done. Um, there's like three m co ordinator, where you and three in coordinator is not just a job for just Electrician's. It's like for for all the rates. And that's where you, um, make sure that all of the all of the work is done in accordance with some procedure, according Thio, whatever equipment you're supposed to be working on, so, um yeah, I'll leave it alone. But the point is, you go from job to job to job a za first class. So you have a really good perspective of the whole entire ship. Um, thing you might become a chief, And once you becoming chief, you actually start talking to the officers a lot more. It's kind of like your world kind of flips up. Um, you can think of it like a like one of those. Our glasses and the first class and the chief are kind of like in the middle. And once you become a chief, you still have to talk to the unit, Um, some. But it's more about telling the first class what he supposed to do. He filters it down, and then the first class tells you and then you filter it up. So that's when you start becoming more administrative oriented. You tell the watch officer, um, what's going on the plant? What maintenance is being performed? Um, And in the unit, you, uh, make sure that everybody is on track to become promoted toe. Make sure that they're on track tow, cover all of their watches. And if there's some kind of problem with that, then you can you can you address it seeing chiefs and master chiefs. They're a little bit more specific. Um, so if you become a senior chief, you do a lot of the things that a chief also does. But you also have a little bit more on career progression. Um, instead of being a three m coordinator, you could be, um, someone who is in charge of entire departments. Not just your unit, a senior chief, because they expect you toe, of course, no electric, uh, electrician's stuff as a senior chief. But they also expect you to be very familiar with the e t stuff. Elektronik technician and very familiar with the mechanical stuff. Maybe you also qualified. Watch Super. Um, work center supervisor. I'm sorry, What supervisor and work center supervisor Where? Um, you actually have to understand the plant way more in depth. You could probably even write books about it, right? Procedures about it. Um, Master Chief, that's the highest that you could be the highest level that you could be, um, in the military. That's a level of e nine. And that's when you are so for the nukes, like they do have a they can't have a master chief that's in charge of the whole entire electrical department. But there's another master chief that's in charge of the whole entire nuclear section and even another master chief. They're all e nine who is in charge of the whole entire ship, and you could be either one of those. Um, it's more like lateral transfers when you're at that level, so yeah, to become a chief and might take about 10 years to become seeing chief could be like 12 or 13. To become a master chief, you could be pushing around 20 years at that time.",
6149b527a8bc831271c192a7,What is a good strategy for setting goals and priorities to advance?,,"a good goal is toe. Go online, figure out your advancement path and make sure that you're checking all the boxes that it takes Thio get to the next level. So, for instance, for first class Petty Officer as an electrician's, um, they expect you to be a leading chief petty officer. Or at least, um, and assistant leading Petty officer. Other jobs could be training pair, officer, quality, quality assurance person or three m co ordinator. There are many jobs that you can do at that level. Make sure that you either do one job really well. Eso you really appeal for a long time or you have lots of experience doing all the other jobs eso they that you have a broad range of what they do. So what you don't want to do is, uh, keep doing the second class job that you were doing before, and there's a lot of opportunity for that. You might become promoted, and they're not going to switch you overnight. So if you wanna be promoted, um, faster to the next level, just say, Hey, you know what? I was a second class. I was a technical person. I was going down there in the in the in the turbine generators and opening up cleaning things, and they allow you to do that. But they really look highly on the people who stop doing that. Figure out what the first classes are supposed to be doing. Um, if they're gonna be leading the whole entire unit of, like, let's say 15 people and start doing it immediately, Um, start seeing what the chief does and saying, and you have to say, Hey, you know what? Is there something that I could do to help you out with that? Yeah, sure. Take these papers or Yeah, sure. This is the qualification, Um, of this unit. Make sure that they're all at, you know, 90% or greater a songs. You start taking on the role of the next level above you, or at least like being very, very proficient at the job that you're supposed to be. Um, then you can start doing those things earlier rather than later.",

We want you to say that you worked at this unit or this shop on this ship and maybe like two or three, um, lines about, like a concisely what you did. Um, And the longer that is, the better it is. So one thing I have to say is, um let's say for me I was on, uh, the USS John C. Stennis and I was on there actually longer than I should have been. I did a six year tour. So for my block, it's gonna say USS John C. Stennis for six years. And of course, I did multiple things on there. Um, I was three and coordinator. I was, uh, lpo of of another unit. I was I covered all of the watches, but in the end, it's just ah, paragraph. You know, maybe a long paragraph. But it's just 11 in general, so it's better to have multiple ships. Um, the more things that you can do them or training that you can do if you could get a C school in there. That's going to be another block. If you can stand a watch for another unit, that's gonna be another block. If you can qualify, uh, something that's out of your rate rather than become propulsion Electrician's let's say for like three years, um, split it up, say, Propulsion Electrician's for a year and a half and then, hey, you know what? Like let me try to qualify what works in a supervisor instead, and that's gonna be another block. So you're talking about quantity over the quality of the job because the quality in the Navy, they expect you to be proficient, vastly proficient at your job. So the longer you do it, it doesn't count. You have to, like, take something and then keep moving.",

You could do tons of jobs around this ship, but if it's not in your field, then it's not gonna quite help you so much. So I think the main source is probably gonna be your chief. Uh, he's gonna tell you, or she will tell you, um, the rules that are available. And sometimes there are things that you don't even no pertain to your rate. One for me was three. M coordinator. I didn't realize that that was a job that a new could take on, but it's a high, high, high position job. Another one that was hidden from me that was going on behind the scenes was, uh, the Tech Pub Library, the Technical Publications library. And you have to be really on familiar with all of the books that are associated with the nuclear field. And you have to know, like where they're supposed to be located. Um, and you also help out when people are doing research. They say, Hey, you know what? Like there's this schematic that I need you should be able toe, you know, find which book it's in and do some of the basic research for him for that. And that's another thing that can promote you. So, um, your chief and other supervisors in your chain of command can actually, like, point you out to some of these jobs that can kind of, like might be something different than what you're used to but might be hidden from you or might be useful in ways that you didn't know about before.",

If you have ah, wife or husband back home, um, it's gonna really uplift their career. You have to make sure that the thing that you're trying to do doesn't conflict with their own personal job. Um, with your kids, uh, they tend to be a little bit more flexible, but make sure that you're not disrupting their life too much. You know, they have a career that they're trying thio to make for themselves, you know, as far as like, their school and their grades. Maybe they don't wanna, like, go to another school just yet. Ah, lot of people. And you might think that that's trivial. But I found especially in Japan Ah, lot of people, like, stay at a certain place or extend their careers even longer based on their kids finishing school at a specific high school. Um and yeah. So make sure you put your family number one, uh number two. You want thio? Talk to people in the in your chain of command who might have experience with the place that you're going. One place I was considering going was, um, going to be thio the ship a submarine tender in Italy. Now I was told that it was gonna be in Guam, and I was prepared toe like, go to that place. But they actually, like, changed their spot and they were in Italy at the time, or it might have been vice versa. And so you think that you might be going toe certain ship, but in reality, you don't know what's actually happening. You don't know the mission of that ship. You don't know the type of job that you're doing on that ship.

And they, um they tell you if you can learn a foreign language or not, rather than give me that test, they actually had to take the nuclear test. And because I did really well at that test, they kind of pushed me into that, um, that field. I don't think it was the field that I was, um, mainly interested in, and in fact, like I was kind of anti engineering at the time. It worked out for me. In the end, I'm glad that I had all of the experience that I that it wanted to with it. But I think if I would have went to cryptologic route, um, that lifestyle, I think, would have been more in line with what I was joining the Navy for, and I think I would have benefited from a little bit of help in determining, like how I could get into that field from the get go",

You'll always get that.

Like find your bibliography and mainly read those chapters before I had never really picked up a bibliography, which is, Ah, a list of books that are required reading for your promotion. When you take the test, they take out little snippets of it or chapters from it. And then, um, they transcribe those into questions on I think they're like 200 questions or something that's supposed to fill out before that, I just thought, Well, you know, like I'm Electrician's, it's my whole entire career. Yeah, you're not supposed to go back and memorize those things. You just, ah, part of you. But, um, the bibliography is, like, really, really shaved down. And, um, it's something that you can study over the course of a few days Ah, week. Or for more hardcore members, you know, an entire month. But it's not.

I went upto Washington, and, you know, it wasn't a choice of, uh, ships we were actually like I moved there because of a ship swap. But, um, yeah, there's no choice with that. And then and then I got out. Um, but two years before I actually got out of the service at my six year point, you're supposed to actually do short command, and I've never experienced a short command before. I had only been on a ship at that time and, um, the recruiter actually said, Hey, you know what? Like we have some opportunities for you, you could become an instructor in New York or he actually gave me the opportunity to go to ah submarine tender in Italy slash Guam. And I didn't do either one of those. And he was kind of pushing forward the benefits of both. You know, if I was an instructor, that would have, you know, actually patted my resume a lot. It's actually in a field education field. Um, that that I'm doing right now, which I really wish was on my resume. Um, at this time, Um, and if it wasn't that, then it would have been going toe Italy. Like I would have loved him. Italy, I think. You know, I always wanted to go to Europe, and I actually jumped over that opportunity to, you know, experience that foreign country.

Uh, that's when I had actually see them and kind of realized, Hey, every place is not just the navy, but yeah, depending on what your rate is like, you interact with other people a lot more, especially if you're in the medical field.

And if you think that you're gonna have the naval, um, the naval profession be your your main career, then I would suggest going to college as soon as possible, even while you're in, preferably before, but, um, sometime, Um, after, uh, after you, after you join, based on some of the free education that you get on and try to become an officer. If that's your thing, um, they have a longer career, spanned, maybe upto 30 years. Um, yet I think a wider range of professions, Um, plus, maybe you joined the service when you were younger. You didn't really know what you wanted to do, and you might be in a profession that, um, you could enjoy. But you could also want experience, different things. I think officers have a much wider range of things that they can do. You can still do the same rate that you are that you're in. There are many nukes that continue to be nukes afterwards. But if you're an officer, yeah, you have the chance toe, um goto many more places to be in a higher responsibility profession, I think eso you you consider? Um, Officer, if you were, if you had a degree during the time now, you could be like me, which is use the profession of the naval profession as a way to get your education. And in that case, I would say you go to school after you get out. Now, um, for me, I stayed in the Navy Reserve, and that really worked really, really good with with going to school. Um, I did my six years active. I took a few classes online. Um, I think I had, like, three or four classes that that I was attempting, at least. And then at the end of eight years, um, after joining the Navy Reserve, I I was in school for full time, basically for the I guess the last, like, eight years or so. I did my undergrad and I did a master's. And I'm currently, um, still in the Navy Reserve and still getting my masters.

Which means that you know exactly how the surface ship works for the engineering department, and you can train other people like, for instance, cooks and boatswain's mates. You know how your service works. Uh, that's another thing you can put on your on your resume. Soto be able to do that to be able to train other people like that. That's, uh, one way that you can expand your career. You can also go to school. Um, everyone goes to a school, at least for uh, if they're a nuke. But there are other schools, like a C school, and there's a long list of schools that you could get from the Web that that you can go to you could go toe school as long as there is a freedom in your department. You could go to school every other year if you wanted Thio. Um, once you get out, then obviously, you know, you can use your Montgomery job Little benefits. Or I guess it's post 9 11. Now that you can, you know, go toe, go to school and take educational classes. You can also do that if you're an active duty member as well. I did that as well. I think I took two classes. Calculus, um, and in English. But I must admit, it is a little bit harder with, ah, full time work.",

They've been given the commission, and for the most part, like like they take it on full charge. And they have a lot of interesting things that they could tell you toe s O that you could grow as a person as well. Um, a little bit above that is the Chang the chief engineer? Um, that's for normal surface ships. I just came back where we had an awesome chang. Who? I think she was a mechanic, but she had a, ah, large understanding of the way the entire plant worked. And I got a lot of information from her on a aircraft care. You have the reactor officer whom I didn't experience s o much, but I still look to them as a leader because you could not tell that they were not the captain of the ship the way they move, the way that they talked the way that they carried themselves. Um, everything that they did was very, very disciplined and organized. And you knew that nothing on that ship would be wrong if they were in charge. That's the way that they carried themselves. Um above them is the CNO and then the president. I like to them a lot less. Obviously, you know, they have the whole entire, um, service to run. However, they are our commanders and chiefs. So whatever they're doing, you have to make sure that they're leading by example. Um, you filtered that down to the troops. So if they're saying, hey, you know what? We have to go to this area and these are the reasons, you know, you have to take that on, and you have to, like, present that presidential atmosphere to the rest of the unit. Um, of course, it could be a little bit political when you're talking about you know, the president less political when you're talking about the CNO. You know this, you know, has mainly one idea for everyone and depending on in for the president, depend on whether it's a Democrat or Republican or some other party like, um, it might be hard Thio get completely behind all of their words. But, um, those are the things that you focus on. You focus on the mission, the mission of the ship, the mission of your aircraft here, and yeah, you should. And I think most military people do have the impression that he is our leader. And he's the example that, um, that we're following. So yeah, from the president all the way down, toe the chief right beside me. You look toe everybody around you, all your leadership, Um, for that for that experience.",

You have a little bit more freedom when you're talking about the short commands that you could go to, um, because we don't just want you always focus on these three ships all the time, so it's kind of like it's not a vacation, but it's more like a different work environment. so that we're not, like, so focused on just electrical things. But those short commands are few and far between hope for the majority of your work, you're expected to kind of, like fall within the field. If you're an officer, then you have a lot more choices.

I didn't really understand what the purpose of a marriage was for. Um, I I know there's a really cheesy thing to say, but, I mean, I have my father, my mother, and they divorced when I was young, so my mother kind of just took care of me. So my impression of what family waas was based on, uh, my mother, my sister who is 10 years older than me and her three kids. And it's a group of people that kind of take care of each other. Uh, maybe some people work and then they put money into the house. Maybe someone has a car, and then they drive people around. Um, maybe people laugh and joke, you know, you go to these places and that's what my impression of marriage waas Um, it's a group of people, um, dealing with family issues.

Uh, she was my, um I lived with her for several years after I split up with my father. I was 18 years old. I bounced around from house to house, and eventually I moved in with my best friend. And, um, like, just staying with that whole entire family for years, One year, two years, uh, hanging out with the kids and the family and the, you know, going toe all these barbecues. And, you know, you develop a love for everyone in the house. You develop a love of strong connection. And I thought that that was, uh, a good way to make a family. However, when I eventually asked the like, my best friend at the time, she was my best friend to be married. I didn't think about her as you know what? Like I'm going to get old and die with this person. I was just thinking, You know what? Like she supported me, I support her. Um, let's just do it. Um, but yeah, months go by and weeks go by and you don't develop the same type of love that should be in a marriage. Uh, you should wanna call back, for instance, I'm unemployment. Um, I should really wanna call back very often to the home. And I was just so involved with work. Um, really, if I would've looked around to my left and my right, There are many husbands who would stand in line for, like, four hours, five hours just to call back to their to their wife. And that wasn't me. And I should have, you know, I should have actually, like, been in more contact with my wife to make it less, and I didn't.

I'm working for this, you know, And that's actually the wrong way to think about it. You should think every single dollar that comes to me should be split around, you know?

It could be indirect, Which means that you might not know the two people, you know, they could be strangers, but you might notice that their friend had been hanging out with them. You can kind of talk with him and say, Hey, you know what? Like I noticed this going on because you kind of go over there and make sure everything's mellow. Another alternative is, uh, you can use the protocol, which is you go to their, uh whatever. Supervisory, um, person is there, So if it's on the ship, it could be an MP military police. If it's out in the club, you could go to the bartender. Maybe there's a manager. Maybe there's a bartender. Maybe there's a local police officer, you know? Um, yeah, You have some authority authoritarian figures that you can go to to kind of like Mel out. The situation on there's also like if none of those work, um, or if you want tohave a little bit more casual, um, way toe talk, these people you can do, um, distraction. That's when, like, you see, you see the two people having some kind of interaction and you say, Hey, you know what? Like let's go play pool or Lett's Let's have this conversation over here. Let's go dancing. Um, you don't mention the topic directly, but you do change the topic based on something that you think might be a little bit more friendly to them.",Sexual Violence

Which means that only a few people know are aware of it. Um, the V a, the Sark, the person, um, even even medical people if if they're in in that in that line and the commanding officer finds out that, um, something happened, but no names are given and the specifics aren't given and unrestricted and unrestricted report on the other hand, uh, it zone by a lot more people, you know, probably the police can be involved, and the commanding officer actually knows the exact situation.

If there's some contention, um, outside of sexual assault, let's say then, um, there could be situations that you don't want to, as especially as a chief. But you start sending people tow opposite, um, workstations. So whereas before you can send anybody with anyone, um, you to just choose two names, you go up there. Um, fix this machine or YouTube. Go, go, go check the voltage. Uh, you you have to know who your people are and how they interact with each other, and you don't wanna push some buttons. Maybe it might take a few weeks to kind of like, um uh, decrease the intensity in the in the unit. So in that case, you know, for temporarily you separate people, um, that might work with with sexual assault. Um, however, when you're dealing with sexual assault, things can happen anywhere you know, especially with with a small unit. So in that case, you might want toe have other people aware of the tension between two people, so that, like whenever there's a new opportunity for the two of them, to be alone that as a as a group, as a team, you kind of like, make sure everybody is on the up and up. Um, for instance, like people could be sitting with each other at, um when they're eating lunch together. And that's ah, really prime opportunity for, um, words to be said, um, threats to be made right If people kind of know the other people in the unit. Um, so even as a supervisor, if you're not there, they can still kind of quell the situation. Um, it might get to a point, uh, that you have to send the person to another unit if if they can't interact with each other. Well, um, if it escalates too much, then you might want toe talk to the VA or the Stark, and they can kind of see where they were to go from there. The experts",Sexual Violence
62709368c8a4f35919c57e68,How to help ensure everyone has a voice rather than a majority clique dominating/shutting out other perspectives?,,"just like with any other job, you're gonna find that some people are a lot more vocal than than others. You got to make sure that the quiet people, they still get the credit that they that they deserve. Um, just because you're quiet doesn't mean that you can't become a good leader. Leaders do need to be vocal, especially if you're talking toe many, many people. But for the rule, like, let's say your, um, grading people from being for being a second class and below, or even a third class and below. Um, you're not graded on those types of leadership responsibilities talking to 5, 10 people. So the quiet people need to have just as much of a voice and, um, need to be graded just as well as someone who is very, very vocal if they're doing the same quality work. Eso chat with the people who aren't very spoken. Um, actually, you want to praise and criticized the work, um, at the right locations as well. Um, for instance, there's a quiet person you might wanna mention everyone. Hey, I really respect um, Semen Johnson over here for doing this job. Maybe they might not say anything during that time, But everyone else knows, Like, Hey, you know what? Like that's how I can, um, make my work better. Um, And then privately, obviously, if they do something wrong, um, no matter what their behavior is, you wanna talk to them one on one personal person to make sure that they understand their faults and the flaws.",Sexual Violence

Um, generally, you try to keep things light. You try to keep things fun. Um, but it's it's really hard.

6271cfdcc1035a55a45080ea,How much does sexual misconduct affect a team compared to other bad behaviors?,,"sexual assault is really different than other bad behaviors in the fact that you can actually, like, lose valuable team members based on it. Um, number one sexual assault generally doesn't have, um, specifically to do with work. Of course, they can occur, um, during the work environment, and that creates bad moral, um, bad morale within the unit. However, um, whether I can, you know, check a pump, you know, for for the correct voltage or not, has nothing to do with, um, me trying to get a date with you later on. So So there's a very, very strong line between work and, um dating, but they mix when you involve sexual assault and sexual harassment. Um, specifically, I remember we had a master chief, and he was one of the good master chiefs that I've had. Um, he was very direct. He's very stern. He got everybody to do the work the right way and efficiently. Um, however, he had, um, some communication with, uh, someone someone in our unit. Eventually. Hey. Got kicked out of the off the ship, and, um, he eventually became a senior chief, and we saw him walking around his career. You know, like it's probably gonna end pretty soon after that ast faras the grill like she stayed on, but she had a badge, and yeah, everyone knew what happened between them. Um, she got to stay on because, like, she's lower. Um, she had a lower responsibility in that, um the higher you go, the more supervisor you are, the more you're gonna be hammered down on, you know, And a zoo was hit, as was her case. I'm not sure that she had a, um her rank removed, but yeah, yeah, that that's, ah, fragmentation in in that case, And it really affects the unit to have someone who's really good at their job being removed and having someone who stays in the unit have that cast that shadow above her for the rest of time that she's there. So sexual assault, sexual harassment, fraternization, all the sexual things that don't really deal with your job.

EM stands for electricians mate. I've been in the Navy for about 20 years in the Navy reserve right now. For the first six years of my naval career I've been on lots of different tours, Aircraft Carrier USS John C Stennis, started off with a nuclear power school. So, the first tour that I had was working in the nuclear engine room in the propulsion plants, fixing electrical lights, working with other people trying to repair pumps, repair valves, um moving the throttles on the ship to provide propulsion. I had a lot of experience with that. There's a lot that went on, but for the most part, it was a satisfactory tour that I spent in south Carolina and New York. The most recent place was Washington.
After that, uh that initial six year tour actually extended for two more years to have a total of eight years, two years of school, six years on the ship. And then I actually got out, I didn't want to get out of the Navy completely actually started joining the Naval Reserve. And I've been in the Navy reserve for the last 10 years For that whole 10 years I've actually been in school working on and off. But for the most part I am, I got to see a lot more of the world through the Navy reserves than I did ever on the ship. They take me to all the, all the different states Washington Hawaii new york again, Norfolk Virginia san Diego. Every single year I actually do something with the Navy for about the summer. We go and we we go to a shipyard and we repair some things or they give us some some kind of training. Outside of the Navy, I've been in school, I've been in um I've been going to USC and I got my master's there for computer science. Before that I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley and currently I'm at the naval postgraduate school in Monterey California. So for the last 20 years I've had a a wide range of experiences from, you know, touring overseas. Um The first time I joined the Navy was right after 9-11 happened. So I was really involved with the wars and I got to see a lot of things that that most people would never see. So I'd say that the Navy has been been pretty good and I'm looking forward to my next tour.",
